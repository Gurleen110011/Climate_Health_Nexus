# EpiClim: Weekly District-Wise all-India Multi-Epidemics Climate-Health Dataset

EpiClim aims to accelerate GeoHealth research by providing a comprehensive, weekly updated, district-wise dataset that tracks multiple epidemics across India in relation to climatic variables. This project helps in understanding the impact of climate change on public health and aids in the development of predictive models for climate-induced disease outbreaks.
